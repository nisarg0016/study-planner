# Pomodoro Timer Feature

## Overview

The Study Planner now includes a fully integrated Pomodoro Timer that helps you stay focused using the proven Pomodoro Technique. The timer automatically tracks your study sessions and creates events in your calendar.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals:
- **25 minutes** of focused work (called a "Pomodoro")
- **5 minutes** of break
- Repeat the cycle

After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

## Features

When you complete a Pomodoro work session, the timer automatically:
1. **Creates an Event** in your calendar marked as "completed"
